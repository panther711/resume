1.Mobile-First Design: With an increasing number of users accessing the internet through their mobile devices, web developers have shifted towards designing websites that are optimized for mobile devices first and foremost.

6.Voice Search Optimization: With the rise of voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, web developers are optimizing their websites for voice searches, including using conversational language and schema markup.

7.Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP): AMP is an open-source framework that allows web developers to create fast-loading, mobile-friendly web pages.

Overall, these trends reflect a focus on creating faster, more engaging, and personalized web experiences for users.
